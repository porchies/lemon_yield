# lemon_yield

### We're making history as the first lemonade company to publish our juice yield

**We're lemonade people, but we're also numbers people**, so we're publishing the juice yield for all batches and all future batches of Porchies Grilled Lemonade.

### Calculations

Juice Yield Percentage is calculated as the following `juice yield = juice weight (grams) / lemon weight (grams)`
